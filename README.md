# SWEATER WEATHER

Welcome to SweaterWeather, a solo project completed by Brian Plantico during Module 3 at the Turing School of Software and Design. SweaterWeather is API which provides estimated travel times and customized forecast data by consuming third party API's including Google GeoCode, Google Directions, Yelp, Giphy, Flickr, and Dark Sky Weather.

SweaterWeather provides seven API endpoints to interact with:
+ [Forecast Request](# Forecast)
+ [Backgrounds Request](# backgrounds)
+ [Munchies Request](# munchies)
+ [Gifs Request](# gifs)
+ [Users Request](# users)
+ [Sessions Request](# sessions)
+ [Road Trip Request](# road_trip)
